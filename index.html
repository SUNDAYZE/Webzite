    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Sundayze (aka Heriberto Delgado Jr.) is a Mexican American musician who grew up in a Calexico, a town on the
        US/Mexico
        border. Growing up, he commuted between the USA and Mexico on a daily basis. To him, his situation is not
        special. In
        fact, he hopes others can relate to the struggles that come from living in two different worlds. Sundayze
        lacked many
        things growing up, but the one thing he always had was the love and support of his parents. He says, “I
        believe that the
        unconditional love and support of my parents was what ultimately gave me the courage to start playing music.
        I was a
        very introverted teen and when I got my first acoustic guitar everything changed. That guitar gave me
        purpose,
        motivation, and desire to learn and grow. Eventually, I started my first metalcore/scene band and that’s
        when I knew
        that music would always be a part of my life. All these experiences culminated when I decided to start
        Sundayze, my solo
        project, which delves more into the alternative rock realm. I was at a point in my life where I felt
        emotionally
        repressed, so I started writing lyrics and singing them. Day by day I realized how much this helped me get
        all the
        negativity out of my heart and thoughts. My hope is to hopefully connect with people around the world
        through my music.”</p>
